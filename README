## Running the Code:
### There are two codes:-
1. SVM.m
2. ConNeuNet.m
(Used readymade functions provided in the DeepLearningToolBoxSupplementary Folder).

You can directly run the two codes.
The SVM.m will ask you for a choice to run either LDA-SVM or PCA-SVM or Linear SVM (User choice driven algoruthm).
The ConNeuNet.m contains the implemented CNN layers and the training and testing (9 readily available functions are used).
